This is the Backend for Plannerize. A social single page web-app that allows users to plan events with different groups of people they belong to. Users have a private dashboard where they can see all the events for all their groups on a calendar, a journal that logs past events, and direct messaging with other users. Users can create groups. Each group has their own dashboard. Here users can invite other users to join, add events by searching for nearby activies using the Yelp API or add events without the search, upvote/downvote events, check the group calendar, and contribute to the group message board.
